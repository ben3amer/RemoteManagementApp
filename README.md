Remote Management App - .NET 6, PostgreSQL, JWT Authentication, Role-Based Authorization

Description:
Welcome to the Remote Management App GitHub repository! This project showcases a robust and scalable application built using cutting-edge technologies including .NET 6, PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, and role-based authorization. The app follows a structured layered architecture and employs the repository and service design patterns to ensure maintainability and extensibility.

Key Features:

Technology Stack: Built on the latest version of .NET 6, leveraging its performance enhancements and new features. The application's data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, providing reliability and flexibility.

JWT Authentication: Implementing JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication to ensure secure and seamless user access. Users can authenticate and interact with the app's features based on their roles and permissions.

Role-Based Authorization: Role-based authorization is a crucial aspect of the app's security framework. Different user roles have access to specific functionalities, maintaining a strict control over who can perform what actions.

Layered Architecture: The app follows a well-defined layered architecture, separating concerns and promoting a modular approach to development. The layers include Presentation, Application Services, Business Logic, and Data Access.

Repository and Service Design Patterns: Employing the repository pattern for data access to abstract away database operations and enhance code maintainability. The service design pattern facilitates a clean separation of business logic from the presentation layer, leading to better testability and scalability.
